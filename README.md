# Project Communications and Guidelines

Hello everyone,  
We have created Slack channels for each team and uploaded the project brief to the Drive folder.  

[x] Please kindly communicate to us, **by the end of the afternoon**, your e-commerce product category and the list of extra features you wish to develop.  
Keep in mind that what you communicate must be maintained until the end of the project.  

The choice of category will influence both the visual aspect and the database structure, so make sure you fully understand the peculiarities of your choice.  

## Useful Questions to Define Your Idea

- What sentiment do you want to convey?
- Who is your target customer?  
- Which market are you targeting?

## First SAL

[x] The first SAL is scheduled for **next Wednesday (07/05/2025, day after tomorrow)**.  
Attached you'll find the schedules for each team.  

We'll meet in the classroom, team by team.  
There will be a waiting room and we'll let you in as soon as we finish with the previous team, so it's better to respect the timing ðŸ˜‰.  

On SAL day, we'll review the database ER diagram together.  
**By tomorrow afternoon** we ask you to send us a screenshot of the diagram.

## Second SAL

By second SAL:

[x] complete the backend
[] finish the home page

## Tips for ER Diagram Design

- Use English names.  
- Write everything in lowercase.  
- Ensure that table and column names clearly describe their content.  
- Indicate the types of relationships.  

To create the diagram, we recommend using [drawsql.app](https://drawsql.app).

## Important Communications

ðŸ“¢ **In case of any absences or delays to SAL meetings**, it's important that you communicate this information personally (where circumstances allow, of course).  
Make sure to do this in your team's Slack channel, remembering to tag us.  

ðŸš€ We said it during the kickoff, we'll write it here too:  
These two weeks will be among the most formative of the entire journey.  
You'll discover how autonomous you've become and how much your analysis, evaluation, and development skills have grown.  

**Programming isn't about writing code, it's about creating solutions... be creative!**  

If you have questions or doubts, you can write to us in your team's channel, remembering to tag us.
